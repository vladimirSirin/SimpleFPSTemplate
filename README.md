# Learning C++ and Unreal Engine 5 by creating a simple multiplayer stealth game.
This is a C++ project based the simple fps template from Tomlooman.
Forked from Tom's repo and working step by step based on the tutorials.

# On Packaged version:
As it is only a demo, there you can only restart the game to try again.
This is a multiplayer game, here's how to play with friends:
- The host press "~" to run console command "Open FirstPersonExampleMap?listen"
- The client should run "open 127.0.0.1:7777" to join the session, replace "127.0.0.1" with your host IP address.

This project is licensed under the Unreal Engine EULA.
